        A crypto degen collectible project ‚Äî where satire meets warped JPEGs. Each NFT is uniquely designed with intention, blending meme culture, creative absurdity, and on-chain value. XRPL users who mint via xrp.cafe will be airdropped our limited-supply meme token after the mint concludes. No gimmicks ‚Äî just organic growth, community vibes, and passive rewards for holders, delivered automatically through LP activity and token-driven distribution.

  <h2 class="faq-heading">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3 class="faq-question">What is Ledger Pail Kids?</h3>
    <p class="faq-answer">Ledger Pail Kids is a satirical digital collectible project built on the XRPL. Each NFT is a 1/1 collectible with a strong meme twist and built-in holder perks.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3 class="faq-question">What do I get when I mint?</h3>
    <p class="faq-answer">Every mint gets you a 1/1 collectible + access to the $ü™£ token faucet post-mint. Airdrops are also planned for holders, distributed equally.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3 class="faq-question">How will holders earn $XRP?</h3>
    <p class="faq-answer">After the collection sells out, NFT holders will earn passively through LP incentives and AMM mechanics on the XRPL. A portion of fees generated from token trading and ecosystem royalties will be distributed to them over time.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3 class="faq-question">Is there a roadmap?</h3>
    <p class="faq-answer">There‚Äôs no traditional roadmap, but utilities are shipping. We believe in organic growth, XRPL-native innovation, and community-led evolution.</p>

<section class="tokenomics fade-in delay-5" id="tokenomics">
  <h2>$ü™£ Tokenomics</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>30% ‚Äî Airdrop</strong><br>
      Airdropped to Ledger Pail Kids NFT holders after mint (~301,926 $ü™£ per NFT).
    </li>
    <li><strong>30% ‚Äî Secondary Market Supply</strong><br>
      Allocated to seed XRPL DEXs & other markets for open trading liquidity. Ensures smooth entry for new buyers and strong market depth from day one.
    </li>
    <li><strong>30% ‚Äî Utility Pool</strong><br>
      LP, rewards, and ecosystem boosts to power future utility and community-driven growth.

    <li><strong>10% ‚Äî Creator Reserve</strong><br>

  </ul>

  <h3>Future Levers (Royalties & Strategic Burns)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Burn Option:</strong> A portion of NFT secondary royalties may be used to buy $ü™£ from the market and send it to a verifiable burn address, permanently reducing supply.</li>
    <li><strong>AMM Boosting:</strong> Royalties can also be injected into AMM pools to deepen liquidity and stabilize price.</li>
    <li><strong>Token Reinvestment:</strong> Royalties may be allocated back into the Utility Pool for ecosystem expansion and holder rewards.</li>
  </ul>

<section class="scarcity-container fade-in delay-5">
  <h2 class="scarcity-heading">NFT Scarcity</h2>
  <div class="scarcity-item">
    <p>
      Only <strong>123 Ledger Pail Kids</strong> NFTs will ever exist. Each NFT is tied to a stream of passive $ü™£ rewards, 
      giving holders every reason to keep theirs. As rewards accumulate, secondary market listings for NFTs will dry up ‚Äî 
      leading to times where none are available or the few listed are <em>sky-high</em> in price. 
      Early minters lock in both the NFT and the long-term reward stream before the supply vanishes from the market.
